      "Took a course on C++ as a Mechanical Engineering undergrad student.",
    text: `My passion for tech got ignited during my third year as a Mechanical
            engineering student when I took a course on C++. I could immediately
            see the endless possiblities that came with programming. Since then,
            I started learning to code on my own and even built a C++ project
            that implemented a few numerical methods in Engineering Maths.
            Unfortnately my laptop developed a fault back then and once again I
            was back to being a Mechanical Engineering student 😂.`,

    text: `Well, I graduated from school and decided to take a year long
    Intense training on software engineering with Holberton School. We
    were first taken through the rigours of Linux, Bash scripting and C
    language to give a thorough and low level understanding of
    programming and problem solving using code. It was very challenging
    but I never back out of a challenge 😎. Eventually we got to the
    higher level programming (Python and Javascript) and it only got
    easier from there 😌. I worked in teams with my peers to build
    different projects and that in turn helped sharpen my communication
    skills and ability to play as a team member..`,

      "Started an Internship as a Devops Engineer at Nautilus Technologies.",
    text: `Tho I specialised as a backend engineer during my training, upon
    completion I got an opportunity to Intern at a Devops consulting
    firm (Nautilus Technologies) to futher deepen my understanding of
    software development lifecycle. On completing my Internship, I had
    now experienced a bit of Devops as an intern, a bit of backend
    during my training at Holberton School and a bit of Frontend from
    building personal projects. It was easy to choose to specialize as a
    frontend engineer as I enjoyed building user facing applications 🤷‍♂️.
    Fortunately at the time, we were in need of a frontend engineer for
    a product we were starting out and guess who got the
    role???........That's right, I DID!😃😃😃. Not only did I get the
    role, my Manager also testified to how impressed he was with my work
    since it was my first Frontend role.`,
